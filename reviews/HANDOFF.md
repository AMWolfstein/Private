# Upstream port handoff

User authorization: continue all remaining PORT_PLAN batches through completion, without
asking again. This supersedes older one-batch stopping notes. Keep checks/checkpoints per
batch, all feature exclusions and no APK. No worktrees or force-push.

Current phase: batch 7 complete. Next: batch 8 (U-304, U-305, U-307, U-312).
Branch/repository: ccr-2fb644cd-nmesyt, /workspace/Private.
Read-only upstream /workspace/mornye-upstream at e0563ffa; divergence v5.1.1 78699a91.
Read AGENTS.md, STATE.md, PORT_PLAN.md and PORT_EXECUTION.md; status/branch/latest commit,
fetch origin and verify before edits. Graphify before editing, update after each logical port.

U-308 completes local lyric quote cards, menu/long-press entry points, on-demand document reads and stale-share guards, restyled using retained Mornye controls. Compatible held-word glow honors reduced motion and a bounded fade window, preserving settled/background ticker suspension. U-302 adds optional local music haptics, stable SAF identity and owned decoder jobs, transport synchronization, basic-motor support and bounded sensitivity/strength settings.

Source → graph: U-308 `d83068e6` → `9ae8c833` (78a5e078/2782b1f7); U-302 `df164fb1` → `ba844ef0` (11c6cf99/2455cabc/9acaa760). Follow-ups: artwork guard lint `b02895b0` → `1bb926e3`; Mornye selection fixture `a9433d82` → `6bb22e86`; virtualized-card assertion `de546bd7` → `e0fd4bbe`.

PASS: analysis clean; Flutter 1692 passed / 3 skipped / zero failures (03:55); Android unit 61 passed / 1 skipped; Rust script NOT RUN (no Rust source changes).
Graph e0fd4bbe, source b02895b0: 23,480 unique nodes / 45,224 valid links; synchronized, existing vendor extraction warnings remain.
No dependencies/schema changes or user-music writes. Music haptics defaults off; physical motor sensation/timing and OS share targets NOT RUN. Android VIBRATE permission is the only permission added. Initial quote-limit fixture assumed all rows remained visible; corrected to reveal rows, assert 5/5 and scope preview checks to LyricsShareCard before final verification. New card preserves local artwork policy; no network provider restored.
No APK, no branding/online/Material restoration or replacement engine. Physical-device
verification NOT RUN. KT-202 remains OPEN, unrelated to the planned UI ports.

Logs: /workspace/batch-7-analyze.log, batch-7-full-tests.log, batch-7-*-graphify.log;
Kotlin/Rust logs only where source changed. Exit files batch-7-flutter.exit plus relevant
native checks. See VERIFICATION.md. Docs checkpoint committed/pushed after checks; verify
HEAD against fetched origin. Latest docs SHA: git log -1 --format=%H -- reviews/HANDOFF.md.

Batch 8: U-304 local Rewind/statistics only; restyle upstream Expressive presentation using retained Mornye primitives. U-305 preserve current category layout/paging, never restore Default view or History/grid preference. Include U-209 locale-cached DateFormat/letter patterns plus U-312 pinned_section_sliver_list with sectioned browsing. U-307 excludes download widget/service and Material shape morphing/theme roles; adapt compatible responsive player-widget functionality. U-312 skips all Material files and already-ported lyric hunks. Native getSafFileModTimes and audio-analysis jobs are now used by haptics: recheck before dead-code cleanup. Batch 9 must add audio-info EQ reporting if EQ is adopted.

SOL-only policy; identity/effort not exposed, no model switching. Continue MEDIUM preference;
escalate reasoning for Rust/FFI/concurrency when needed. Activate
/workspace/toolchains/activate.sh; Graphify /workspace/toolchains/graphify/bin/graphify.
Existing cloud setup reused. Code → graph → docs commits; tests at batch boundaries.
